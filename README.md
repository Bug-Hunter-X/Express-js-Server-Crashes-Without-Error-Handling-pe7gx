This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of proper error handling. The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js server that is vulnerable to crashing if an error occurs during request processing. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that implements comprehensive error handling to prevent crashes and provide informative responses to clients.
